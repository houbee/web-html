                    <p>Should be known as the year of Segwit. The cryptocurrency community was introduced to this new system during the year and thus far has felt the impact twice with the promise of a third hard fork looming for later in November. We take a look at 2017 and what the market impact of Segwit2X has been – the good and the bad.
                    </p>
                    <p>Segwit2X is a result of the New York Agreement that was formulated in May 2017. The agreement was drafted by miners and developers and aims to increase the Bitcoin blockchain from 1MB to 2MB. Ever since its introduction to the world in 2014, Bitcoin has grown to such an extent that the blockchain is failing to keep up with the demand for the golden standard of the crypto world. Transaction delays and consequent congestion has forced the crypto community to come up with a solution to the problem. Remember that Bitcoin has open source software and even though Segwit2X may solve a lot of problems the community are currently experiencing, there is no way of telling what the future holds and if a soft fork may be required at a later stage. One can look at a hard fork as a way of upgrading a system’s software in order to accommodate more transactions and to ease the process.
